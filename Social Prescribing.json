Problems recorded here may link to the problem list held in a shared care record or GP system for a person using services. \u2022 Goals and hopes are defined as: The overall goals, hopes, aims or targets that the person has.\n                                    Including anything that the person wants to achieve that relates to their future health and wellbeing. Each goal may include a description of why it is important to the person. Goals may also be ranked in order of importance or priority to the person. For example, \u2018weight loss\u2019; smoking cessation\u2019; \u2018reducing alcohol intake\u2019; \u2018increased sleep\u2019. \u2018Goals\u2019 tends to\n                                    be historically a more medically-used term, whereas \u2018hopes\u2019 is used more widely in social care settings. \u2022 It should be possible to include tables (e.g. weekly schedule), diagrams or images (e.g. to illustrate how a person has made progress towards a goal) as well as video and audio clips (i.e. as a communication tool for individuals with complex accessibility\n                                    requirements). \u2022 It should be possible to prioritise goals, indicating the importance of each goal to the person (e.g. a scale 1 to 10). \u2022 Each action may also have an associated additional indicator showing how confident the person is to carry it out (e.g. a scale from 1 to 10). \u2022 The care and support plan should be structured in a way that supports digital\n                                    information exchange, with separate sections for strengths, needs and problems which can be linked to specific goals. \u2022 Of particular importance is the link between needs in a care plan and related goals. Each goal must link to specific needs, as well as any actions associated with it. Goals may also have related outcomes. \u2022 The sections associated with goals\n                                    and actions that are the focus of specific care professionals should be interoperable with the care plan that professional uses for their day to day work. Updates to the care and support plan section may include: \u2022 Add, edit or archive strengths, needs, concerns or problems. If a strength/need/concern becomes more or less important, then goals may need to be\n                                    changed, as will associated actions. \u2022 Add, edit or archive goals. When a goal is archived it should be possible to also archive the actions associated with it. If the actions are still valid it should be possible to attach them to another goal. \u2022 Add, edit or archive actions. Once an action has been completed (i.e. status updated to indicate it has been\n                                    completed), it should be possible to archive it from the care and support plan. It should be removed from the current active view of the plan, but available to view in previous versions of the plan. \u2022 Recording outcomes related to goals. Once a goal has been achieved, it should be possible to archive it from the care and support plan, so that it is removed from\n                                    the view of the current plan, but available to view in previous versions of the care and support plan.</span> \n                                 <br clear=\"none\"/> \n                            ", "description": "Details of the person needs, concerns or problems <br clear=\"none\"/> \n                    ", "concept": [{"type": "item", "minimumMultiplicity": "0", "maximumMultiplicity": "1", "mro": "R", "name": "Coded value", "implamentationGuidance": "\n                                 <p>There is a new refset \"Social prescribing needs and concerns simple reference set\" (<a href=\"https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&conceptId1=1373501000000105&edition=uk-edition&release=&server=https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/sct-browser-api/snomed&langRefset=999001261000000100,999000691000001104\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&conceptId1=1373501000000105&edition=uk-edition&release=&server=https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/sct-browser-api/snomed&langRefset=999001261000000100,999000691000001104</a>) (SCTID: 1373501000000105) which should be used in place of the \"Health issues simple refset\" specified in the\n                                    valueset.\u00a0</p> \n                            ", "description": "The coded value associated with the person's needs, concerns or problems.", "valueSets": "\n                             <div>SNOMED CT : -\u00a0^1127581000000103 |Health issues simple reference set|</div> \n                        "}, {"type": "item", "minimumMultiplicity": "0", "maximumMultiplicity": "1", "mro": "R", "name": "Free text", "implamentationGuidance": "Use free text to provide detail of the person\u2019s need as the refset is high level categories.  <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n                                    <br clear=\"none\"/>\n                                </span> \n                            ", "description": "The person\u2019s needs, concerns or problems (in free text).
