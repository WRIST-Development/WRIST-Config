In cases where there is no structured option, they can be entered as free text in clinical notes alongside the associated symptoms, signs, or abnormal test results that led to the suspected diagnosis.

These can include symptoms, signs, noteworthy test results, risk factors, psychological factors, social factors, health-related issues, or official diagnoses.
