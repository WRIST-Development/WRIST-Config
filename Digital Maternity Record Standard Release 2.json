As in\n                                            other clinical settings where there is overwriting of a past entry of for example medical history there will be an audit trail of this and associated accountability.

Local implementation may utilise a local information model to record the dynamic parts of the expression, but should note the SNOMED CT reference model and attributes, as bindings. It is most important to take this into account when sharing historical information without loss of meaning.</p>\n                                        <p>243796009 |Situation with explicit context (situation)|</p>\n                                        <p>{</p>\n                                        <p>246090004 |Associated finding (attribute) = Your history finding code here,</p>\n                                        <p>408731000 |Temporal context (attribute) = 410513005 |In the past (qualifier value)|</p>\n                                        <p>}</p>\n                                        <p>243796009 |Situation with explicit context (situation)|</p>\n                                        <p>{</p>\n                                        <p>363589002 |Associated procedure (attribute)| = Your history procedure code here,</p>\n                                        <p>408731000 |Temporal context (attribute) = 410513005 |In the past (qualifier value)|</p>\n                                        <p>}</p>\n                                    </li>\n                                </ul>                                             \n                            ", "description": "\n                     <p>Group containing details of past clinical and social care history</p> \n                ", "concept": [{"type": "group", "minimumMultiplicity": "0", "maximumMultiplicity": "*", "mro": "R", "name": "Clinical History record entry", "implementationGuidance": "Information relating to the evolution of each presenting complaint, and the patient's relevant health history.", "description": "Information relating to the evolution of each presenting complaint, and the patient's relevant health history.", "concept": [{"type": "group", "minimumMultiplicity": "0", "maximumMultiplicity": "1", "mro": "R", "name": "Patient\u2019s reason for referral", "implementationGuidance": "Patient stated reason for referral.
