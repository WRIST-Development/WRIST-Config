It is the highest level to logically group data elements that may be independent or related. For example, \u2018Medications and medical devices\u2019 includes sets of related elements\n                                            with dependencies between the elements whereas 'Social context' includes a set of independent elements or information items, grouped in a logical section.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Record entry</span> \u2502 A record entry within a section is used where a set of information is repeated for a particular item, and there can be multiple items. For\n                                            example, for each medication administered there is a set of information associated with that medication.\u00a0</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Cluster </span>\u2502 This is a set of elements put together as a group and which relate to each other \u2502 For example,\u00a0 'Insulin calculations cluster', which is the set of elements used to calculate a particular\n                                            mealtime or correction bolus dose of insulin.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Element</span> \u2502 The data item.

This clarifies how many entries can be made i.e. zero, one or many entries. The number of records expected and allowed are displayed as: 0\u2026\u2026* = zero to many record entries are allowed; 0\u2026\u20261 = zero to one record entry is allowed; 1\u2026\u20261 = one record is expected; 1\u2026\u2026* = one to many records are expected. For example,\n                                                the \u2018Medications and medical devices\u2019 section may have zero to many medication item records in it and is displayed as 0\u2026\u2026 *.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conformance</span> \u2502 Conformance defines what information is \u2018mandatory\u2019, \u2018required\u2019 or \u2018optional\u2019 and applies to sections, record entries, clusters and elements. The IT system must\n                                                be developed to be handle all the information elements that are defined in the Standard but not all the information is required for every individual record or information transfer. The following set of rules apply to enable implementers to cater for the end users (senders and receivers) requirements: Mandatory \u2013 the information must be\n                                                included;\u00a0Required \u2013 if it exists, the information must be included; Optional \u2013 a local decision is made as to whether the information is included. These rules apply at all levels and give the flexibility to allow local clinical or professional decisions on some information that is included, while being clear on what is important information to\n                                                include. For example, a person subject to a referral may have many assessments, but not all of these will be relevant to the referral.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> NB</span>: It is permitted to upgrade a conformance rule but not to down grade one. For instance, a section that is classed as optional in the standard can be upgraded to required or\n                                                mandatory in local implementations. However, one that is classed mandatory or required cannot be downgraded to required or optional.\u00a0</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Valuesets</span> \u2502 Valuesets describe precisely how the information is recorded in the system and communicated between systems. This is required for interoperability (for\n                                                information to flow between one IT system and another).\u00a0 The information can be text, multi-media or in a coded format. If coded it can be constrained to SNOMED CT and specific SNOMED CT reference sets, NHS Data Dictionary values or other code sets.</li></ul>\n                                        <div><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">2.2 How we expect the Diabetes Self-Management Information Standard to be used</span>\n                                            <br clear=\"none\"/>\n                                            <br clear=\"none\"/>\n                                            <span style=\"line-height: 103%;\">What is defined is a set of information that covers a broad range of what can be shared relating to diabetes self-management. How this information is transferred to (e.g. via the cloud) and stored in a person's electronic health record for diabetes is out of scope. It is recognised that different local implementations\n                                                across settings may differ in their level of digital maturity. For example some systems may not be capable, at least at first, of storing/ processing raw data from diabetes devices or platforms (</span>and using this to calculate and display derived summary statistics). It may be that in such cases initial 'simpler' implementations may preferentially\n                                            send and receive pre-calculated metrics and preformed graphical representations of the data for display to the end-user (e.g. Ambulatory Glucose Profiles (AGPs) shared as PDFs) with a view to progressing to more complex/ sophisticated implementations later.

For example, a person with diabetes self-managing their condition at home may record their own blood pressure or conduct self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). They may also be using diabetes devices\n                                                including CGM, connected insulin pens or ambulatory insulin pumps. In all cases\u00a0it is important that the full context of the information is known (where and when the measurement was done and by whom or what device). The principle, for PRSB standards, is that for clinical safety and efficacy of communications, the key contextual data described within\n                                                the PRSB Provenance Data Standard should be shared with the message as instructed in the Diabetes Self-Management Information Standard. The principle applied in the information model is that where it is important (from a professional perspective) to know who or what device undertook the activity and who or what device recorded the that this is made\n                                                available to the end-user of the receiving system.

These should be visible to the end user together and in the user-interface. For example, the PRSB consultation identified the Ipswich Touch Test * as an assessment that is being increasingly used by professionals and people with diabetes as part of their routine foot examination (see assessments). However, other clinically similar rapid footcare assessments, such as the 10g monofilament test would be recorded under the examination findings section of the standard as these are coded as clinical finding concepts in SNOMED CT. Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and Toe brachial pressure index are observable entity concepts in SNOMED and would be recorded under observations.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SNOMED CT ID</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2502\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fully specified name (FSN)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u2502\u00a0\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Implementation guidance</span></p>\n<p>299910003 \u2502 Finding of light touch (finding) \u2502 Descendants of concept for 10g monofilament outcome recorded in Examination findings</p>\n<p>252059006 \u2502 Vascular measure (observable entity) \u2502 Descendants of concept for e.g., toe brachial index, ankle brachial pressure index and lower limb doppler pressures recorded in Observations.</p>\n<p>1443851000000100 \u2502 Ipswich Touch Test score (observable entity) \u2502\u00a0Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p>\n<p>763258007\u00a0\u2502\u00a0Site, Ischemia, Neuropathy, Bacterial Infection and Depth classification total score (observable entity)\u00a0\u2502\u00a0Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p>\n<p>763004009\u00a0\u2502\u00a0University of Texas Wound Classification System grade (observable entity)\u00a0\u2502\u00a0Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p>\n<p>763005005\u00a0\u2502\u00a0University of Texas Wound Classification System stage (observable entity)\u00a0\u2502\u00a0Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p>\n<p>1099121000000104\u00a0\u2502\u00a0Young Townson FootSkin Hydration Scale for Diabetic Neuropathy level (observable entity)\u00a0\u2502\u00a0Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p>\n<p><br/> * [See\u00a0https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.12450 ;\u00a0https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jcte.2021.100252]</p>\n<p><br/> Where required codes are unavailable the free text field should be used and consideration given to the submission of a new code request to UK SNOMED CT request submission portal (see https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/rsp/user/guest/home.jsf).
